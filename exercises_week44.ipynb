    "\n",
    "1. The first is a version of the exercises from week 39, where you got started with the report and github repository for project 1, only this time for project 2. This part is required, and a short feedback to this exercise will be available before the project deadline. And you can reuse these elements in your final report.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second is a list of questions meant as a summary of many of the central elements we have discussed in connection with projects 1 and 2, with a slight bias towards deep learning methods and their training. The hope is that these exercises can be of use in your discussions about the neural network results in project 2. **You don't need to answer all the questions, but you should be able to answer them by the end of working on project 2.**\n"

    "\n",
    "**c)** Add a figure in your report which meets as few requirements as possible of what we consider a good figure in this course, while still including some results, a title, figure text, and axis labels. Describe in the text of the report the different ways in which the figure is lacking. (This should not be included in the final report for project 2.)\n",
